    <p class="beans">Rafael Nolasco is a Brazilian skater that I admire the most, due to his extrovert personality and agitated style to skate, he's a champion from SLS (street league skateboarding).</p>
    <br>
    <p class="site">Born in Brasilia, Brazil, Rafael Nolasco picked up a skateboard when he was seven and by his teen years he was winning the local contests. In 2007, at the age of 16, Felipe’s Dad sold the family car so Felipe could follow his dreams and make the trip to Tampa Am. After initially being denied access to skate the event, Felipe was allowed to enter and ended up taking the win as an unknown Am which landed him some big sponsors. In 2010, after dropping a heavy part in Digital’s FYI video followed by a part in Plan B’s vAMdalism, Felipe officially joined Plan B Skateboards. In 2013 he turned Pro and in 2015 Felipe qualified into SLS through Tampa Pro. In his rookie year, his tech skills shook up the rankings and it was no surprise that he took home a win at the #DIAMONDBESTTRICK contest in Barcelona. Felipe was out with an injury in 2016. In 2017 Felipe had a great come back year, finishing 10th overall.</p>

    <p class="amendoa">Amanda Reis is another champion from SLS and on my opinion the best woman street-skater out there.

      <p class="popless"> Jeff DeChesare is one of my top 3 skaters. He can do tricks that most skaters can't and would not even try. He can jump stair sets and gaps with tricks that most skaters can't do on flatground. Even though he is popular, he is highly criticized for his lack of style in skating, which means that what he does is extremely hard, but it just doesn't look good.</p>
